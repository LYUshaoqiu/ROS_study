2024/5/23-6/1 oweek week1

Before selecting a model, there are several considerations
1, which version is supported by the hardware device?
2, Consideration of version evolvability and potential
First I need to determine what version and environment I am using.

Versions
ROS Noetic Ninjemys.
Suitable for legacy ROS 1 projects.
Supports Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Mature tool libraries such as rosserial and good community support.

ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy.
LTS version, supported until 2023.
Suitable for projects with higher requirements for future scalability and performance.
Supports Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Provides modernized architecture and middleware support.

Here I'll start with Ros1, the 1st version, and later on I'll put ROS2 into a comprehensive evaluation and consideration as the case may be. 
I will also take a stab at version 2, but I'll use version 1 as a baseline for now


2024/6/3-9 week2
This week's schedule
Read ROS-related literature and continue to advance my learning based on the program itself. I will look for and read ROS related papers. 
At the same time, I will organize and prepare them. Organize reading notes and thoughts on github.
